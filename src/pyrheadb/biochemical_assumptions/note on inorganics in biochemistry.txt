Living organisms are primarily built from organic molecules, which contain carbon and are typically associated with life's processes.
However, inorganic molecules also play crucial roles in the structure and function of living organisms.
Here are some key inorganic molecules involved:

Water (H₂O): The most abundant molecule in cells, critical for various biological processes including metabolism,
temperature regulation, and as a solvent for biochemical reactions.

Minerals: Various inorganic ions and compounds such as sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺),
chloride (Cl⁻), phosphate (PO₄³⁻), and sulfate (SO₄²⁻). These ions are essential for nerve transmission, muscle contraction,
bone formation, and are components of many enzymes and cellular structures.

Gases: Oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) are crucial for processes like respiration and photosynthesis.

Trace Elements: Elements like iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) are vital as cofactors in various
enzymatic reactions.

Living organisms always build their biochemistry from a small collection of carboxylic acids that can be interconverted togenerate the five precursors to all other metabolic pathways:
(1) acetate (CHEBI:30089), or acetyl when it is bound to a cofactor, is the biosynthetic precursor to lipids and terpenoids,
(2) pyruvate (CHEBI:15361) is the precursor to sugars and various amino acids,
(3) oxaloacetate (CHEBI:16452) is the precursor to various amino acids and pyrimidines,
(4) succinate (CHEBI:30031) is the precursor to various cofactors, and
(5) α-ketoglutarate (CHEBI:16810) is the precursor to various amino acids.
The central role of these compounds in building all life’s chemistry suggests they were likely involved in prebiotic chemistry
